/**
 * This program implements a simple card guessing game. 
 * A card is randomly selected from a list of 9 cards and 
 * hidden from view while the player attempts to guess which
 * card it is. 
 * The 9 cards are displayed face up in a 3x3 grid and the player
 * guesses by clicking on one of the cards.
 * The player can opt to be given multiple chances to guess the card.
 * If the player wins or runs out of guesses, a 'show' button is
 * displayed, allowing the player to reveal the answer.
